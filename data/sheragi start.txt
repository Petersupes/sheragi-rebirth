			`This planet is populated by an alien species that, somehow, look similiar to the dragons of human mythology. Even more surprising is that amid the towering dragon alien people are a scattering of humans seemingly unbothered by the aliens as they rush about the spaceport doing their everyday business. Would you like to find someone who can tell you what is going on here?`

				`	(Yes.)`
				`	(Not right now.)`

			`	You approach a human dockworker who is busy chatting and laughing with one of the giant aliens. "Something you need friend?" he says.`
			`	Hesitantly eyeing the menacingly sized dragon, you nod. Noticing your gaze the alien puts out a huge clawed hand, and after a moment of fear you're about to be killed, you realise it's offering a fistbump which you quickly return.`
			choice
				`	"What are you?"`
					goto who
				`	"Why are there humans here?"`
			`	They both look at you with strange looks. "Now I don't who you've been listening to but humans have every right to live in Sheragi space," the man says, "these Sheragi that treat humans awfully, disgraceful."`
			choice
				`	"What's a Sheragi?"`
			label who
			`	Despite it's alien features the look on the dragon's face is unmistakably on of confusion. "I'm a Sheragi," It says slowly, "how did you not know that?"`
			choice
				`	"I just came here from human space, I wasn't aware of the Sheragi or that other humans had come here."`
					goto what
				`	"I'm sorry, I thought you would've expected that question considering the other human visitors here."`
			`	"What do you mean visitors?" the man asks. "Most of us live here."`
			choice
				`	"I assumed you were just visiting from human space like I am."`
			label what
			`	"You came from human space?" they both shout in shock. "How?" the man asks.`
			choice
				`	"Through the wormhole north of here."`
					goto wormhole
				`	"I used a quantum keystone, you don't have those?"`
					goto stone
			label wormhole
			`	"That wormhole is unstable, how did you survive passing through?" the human asks.`
			choice
				`	"I used a quantum keystone, you don't have those?"`
			label stone
			`	"We don't have quantum keystones anywhere, if that's how you got here you should hold onto it, it may be your only way back." the Sheragi says.`
			choice
				`	"If you don't have quantum keystones, how did other humans get here?"`
				`	"Well clearly I'm not the first human to come to Sheragi space, how did they all get here?"`
			`	"All the humans in Eden were born here, descendents from a fleet of refugees 500 years ago." the Sheragi says. "The records indicate that they were fleeing a war against genetically modified humans known as alphas and very briefly a wormhole which had always been an unstable cosmic mess, stabilised and through the humans went, unknowingly to Eden." the man says.`
			`	You talk for a while longer, learning little more information except that there are a dangerous group of Sheragi to the north who will attack on sight. You thank them both for stopping to talk with you, and the Sheragi responds, "It is no problem. Honour upon you."`

				`	"What do you mean?"`
			`	"You are not from Eden," he says. "You are the first visitor from outside of Sheragi space since the first group of humans came here 500 years ago. From what I understand you have done so using something called a quantum keystone. Additionally, you did not know about the Sheragi before coming here, so I can only assume that our kin are lost to time. I require that when you leave Sheragi space you do not mention it to anyone."`
