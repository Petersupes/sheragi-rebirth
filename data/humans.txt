	description "The age old design of the Firebird was once one of the most common ships during the alpha wars. As such it was one of the few designs the Humans that fled to Sheragi space had access to. After half a millenium this ship has recieved heavy design tweaks to make it better able to stand up against the Behemoth Sheragi warships."

	description `The Tycho Crater Cooperative's Dromedary was one of the foremost colonization ships during the early era before piracy became rampant and triggered the necessity for city-ships to be more combat-oriented. These ships incorporate extensive hydroponics, large construction equipment installations, and hundreds of densely packed "dream cells" built to transport people in bulk.`
